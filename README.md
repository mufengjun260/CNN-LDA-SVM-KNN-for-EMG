# CNN-LDA-SVM-KNN-for-EMG
A synthetic approach is proposed for hand motion recognition with surface EMG signals. We used CNN features which were automatically extracted from the raw input image for three traditional classifiers: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN).
